  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# About me

I am an enthusiastic aerospace engineering student with a passion for exploring diverse fields and continuously expanding my knowledge. My research interests lie in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, VTOL configurations, Control and Optimization, and Machine Learning Applications. I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn and grow in this dynamic field !

<!-- I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. My research interests lie in statistics, and I am currently exploring various fields of statistics methodology. I worked on exact Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling using Bernoulli factories with Prof. [Dootika Vats ](https://dvats.github.io/). Prior to that I worked at the [Decision lab](https://sites.google.com/view/decisionlabiitk/home?authuser=0) on modelling behavioural data to analyze the effect of stress on dynamic decision making.  -->
